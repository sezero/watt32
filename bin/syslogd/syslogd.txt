NAME
       sysklogd - Linux system logging utilities.

SYNOPSIS
       syslogd	[  -a socket ] [ -d ] [ -f config file ] [ -h ] [
       -l hostlist ] [ -m interval ] [ -n ] [ -p socket ] [ -r	]
       [ -s domainlist ] [ -v ]


DESCRIPTION
       Sysklogd	 provides two system utilities which provide sup
       port for system logging and kernel message trapping.  Sup
       port of both internet and unix domain sockets enables this
       utility package to support both local and remote	 logging.

       System  logging	is  provided  by  a version of syslogd(8)
       derived from the stock BSD sources.   Support  for  kernel
       logging	is  provided by the klogd(8) utility which allows
       kernel logging to be  conducted	in  either  a  standalone
       fashion or as a client of syslogd.

       Syslogd	provides  a kind of logging that many modern pro
       grams use. Every logged message contains at least  a  time
       and  a hostname field, normally a program name field, too,
       but that depends on how trusty the logging program is.

       While the syslogd sources have  been  heavily  modified	a
       couple of notes are in order.  First of all there has been
       a systematic attempt to insure that  syslogd  follows  its
       default, standard BSD behavior.	The second important con
       cept to note is that this  version  of  syslogd	interacts
       transparently  with  the	 version  of  syslog found in the
       standard libraries.  If a binary linked	to  the	 standard
       shared libraries fails to function correctly we would like
       an example of the anomalous behavior.

       The main configuration file /etc/syslog.conf or an  alter
       native file, given with the -f option, is read at startup.
       Any lines that begin with the hash mark (``#'') and  empty
       lines  are  ignored. If an error occurs during parsing the
       whole line is ignored.



OPTIONS
       -a socket
	      Using this  argument  you	 can  specify  additional
	      sockets  from  that syslogd has to listen to.  This
	      is needed if you're going to let	some  daemon  run
	      within  a	 chroot() environment.	You can use up to
	      19 additional sockets.  If your  environment  needs
	      even more, you have to increase the symbol MAXFUNIX
	      within the syslogd.c source file.	 An example for a
	      chroot()	daemon	is  described  by the people from

	      OpenBSD at  http://www.psionic.com/papers/dns.html.

       -d     Turns on debug mode. Using this the daemon will not
	      proceed a fork(2) to set itself in the  background,
	      but  opposite  to	 that  stay in the foreground and
	      write much debug information on  the  current  tty.
	      See the DEBUGGING section for more information.

       -f config file
	      Specify  an  alternative configuration file instead
	      of /etc/syslog.conf, which is the default.

       -h     By default syslogd will  not  forward  messages  it
	      receives from remote hosts.  Specifying this switch
	      on the command line will cause the  log  daemon  to
	      forward any remote messages it receives to forward
	      ing hosts which have been defined.

       -l hostlist
	      Specify a hostname that should be logged only  with
	      its  simple  hostname  and  not  the fqdn. Multiple
	      hosts may be specified using the colon (``:'') sep
	      arator.

       -m interval
	      The  syslogd  logs  a mark timestamp regularly. The
	      default interval between two -- MARK -- lines is 20
	      minutes.	 This  can  be	changed with this option.
	      Setting the interval to zero turns it off entirely.

       -n     Avoid auto-backgrounding. This is needed especially
	      if  the  syslogd	is  started  and  controlled   by
	      init(8).

       -p socket
	      You  can	specify an alternative unix domain socket
	      instead of /dev/log.

       -r     This option will enable  the  facility  to  receive
	      message  from  the network using an internet domain
	      socket with the syslog service  (see  services(5)).
	      The default is to not receive any messages from the
	      network.

	      This option is introduced in  version  1.3  of  the
	      sysklogd	package.  Please  note	that  the default
	      behavior is the  opposite	 of  how  older	 versions
	      behave, so you might have to turn this on.

       -s domainlist
	      Specify  a  domainname  that should be stripped off
	      before logging. Multiple domains may  be	specified
	      using  the  colon	 (``:'') separator. Remember that
	      the first match is used, not the best.

       -v     Print version and exit.


SIGNALS
       Syslogd reacts to a set of signals. You may easily send	a
       signal to syslogd using the following:

	      kill -SIGNAL `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid`


       SIGHUP This  lets syslogd perform a re-initialization. All
	      open  files  are	closed,	 the  configuration  file
	      (default	is  /etc/syslog.conf)  will be reread and
	      the syslog(3) facility is started again.

       SIGTERM
	      The syslogd will die.

       SIGINT, SIGQUIT
	      If debugging is enabled these are	 ignored,  other
	      wise syslogd will die.

       SIGUSR1
	      Switch  debugging	 on/off.  This option can only be
	      used if  syslogd	is  started  with  the	-d  debug
	      option.

       SIGCHLD
	      Wait  for	 childs	 if  some  were	 born, because of
	      wall'ing messages.


CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES
       Syslogd uses a slightly different syntax for its	 configu
       ration  file than the original BSD sources. Originally all
       messages of a specific priority and above  were	forwarded
       to the log file.

	      For  example  the	 following line caused ALL output
	      from daemons using the daemon facilities (debug  is
	      the  lowest  priority,  so  every	 higher will also
	      match) to go into /usr/adm/daemons:

		   # Sample syslog.conf
		   daemon.debug		    /usr/adm/daemons

       Under the new scheme this behavior remains the same.   The
       difference  is  the  addition  of four new specifiers, the
       asterisk (*) wildcard, the equation sign (=), the exclama
       tion mark (!), and the minus sign (-).

       The * specifies that all messages for the specified facil
       ity are to be directed to the destination.  Note that this
       behavior is degenerate with specifying a priority level of



Version 1.3		 12 October 1998			3





SYSKLOGD(8)	   Linux System Administration	      SYSKLOGD(8)


       debug.  Users have indicated that the asterisk notation is
       more intuitive.

       The  =  wildcard is used to restrict logging to the speci
       fied priority class.  This allows,  for	example,  routing
       only debug messages to a particular logging source.

	      For example the following line in syslog.conf would
	      direct debug  messages  from  all	 sources  to  the
	      /usr/adm/debug file.

		   # Sample syslog.conf
		   *.=debug	       /usr/adm/debug

       The  ! is used to exclude logging of the specified priori
       ties. This affects all  (!)  possibilities  of  specifying
       priorities.

	      For  example the following lines would log all mes
	      sages of the facility mail except	 those	with  the
	      priority	info  to  the /usr/adm/mail file. And all
	      messages from news.info  (including)  to	news.crit
	      (excluding)  would  be  logged to the /usr/adm/news
	      file.

		   # Sample syslog.conf
		   mail.*;mail.!=info	    /usr/adm/mail
		   news.info;news.!crit	    /usr/adm/news

       You may use it intuitively as an exception specifier.  The
       above  mentioned	 interpretation is simply inverted. Doing
       that you may use

	    mail.none
       or
	    mail.!*
       or
	    mail.!debug

       to skip every message that comes	 with  a  mail	facility.
       There is much room to play with it. :-)

       The - may only be used to prefix a filename if you want to
       omit sync'ing the file after every write to it.

       This may take some acclimatization for  those  individuals
       used  to	 the pure BSD behavior but testers have indicated
       that this syntax is somewhat more flexible  than	 the  BSD
       behavior.  Note that these changes should not affect stan
       dard syslog.conf(5) files.  You must  specifically  modify
       the configuration files to obtain the enhanced behavior.

SYSKLOGD(8)	   Linux System Administration	      SYSKLOGD(8)


SUPPORT FOR REMOTE LOGGING
       These modifications provide network support to the syslogd
       facility.  Network support means that messages can be for
       warded  from one node running syslogd to another node run
       ning syslogd where they will be actually logged to a  disk
       file.

       To  enable  this	 you have to specify the -r option on the
       command line. The default behavior is that  syslogd  won't
       listen to the network.

       The  strategy  is  to have syslogd listen on a unix domain
       socket for locally generated log messages.  This	 behavior
       will  allow syslogd to inter-operate with the syslog found
       in the standard C library.  At the same time syslogd  lis
       tens  on	 the  standard syslog port for messages forwarded
       from other hosts. To have this  work  correctly	the  ser
       vices(5)	 files	(typically  found  in /etc) must have the
       following entry:

		   syslog	   514/udp

       If this entry  is  missing  syslogd  neither  can  receive
       remote  messages	 nor send them, because the UDP port cant
       be opened. Instead syslogd will die  immediately,  blowing
       out an error message.

       To  cause messages to be forwarded to another host replace
       the normal file line in the syslog.conf file with the name
       of  the host to which the messages is to be sent prepended
       with an @.

	      For example, to forward ALL messages  to	a  remote
	      host use the following syslog.conf entry:

		   # Sample syslogd configuration file to
		   # messages to a remote host forward all.
		   *.*		  @hostname

	      To forward all kernel messages to a remote host the
	      configuration file would be as follows:

		   # Sample configuration file to forward all kernel
		   # messages to a remote host.
		   kern.*	  @hostname


       If the remote hostname  cannot  be  resolved  at	 startup,
       because the name-server might not be accessible (it may be
       started after syslogd) you don't have to	 worry.	  Syslogd
       will  retry  to	resolve	 the name ten times and then com
       plain. Another possibility to avoid this is to  place  the
       hostname in /etc/hosts.




Version 1.3		 12 October 1998			5





SYSKLOGD(8)	   Linux System Administration	      SYSKLOGD(8)


       With  normal  syslogds  you  would get syslog-loops if you
       send out messages that were received from a remote host to
       the  same  host	(or more complicated to a third host that
       sends it back to the first one, and so on). In  my  domain
       (Infodrom  Oldenburg)  we accidently got one and our disks
       filled up with the same single message. :-(

       To avoid this in	 further  times	 no  messages  that  were
       received	 from  a  remote host are sent out to another (or
       the same) remote host  anymore.	If  there  are	scenarios
       where  this  doesn't  make  sense, please drop me (Joey) a
       line.

       If the remote host is located in the same  domain  as  the
       host, syslogd is running on, only the simple hostname will
       be logged instead of the whole fqdn.

       In a local network you may provide a central log server to
       have all the important information kept on one machine. If
       the network consists of different domains you  don't  have
       to complain about logging fully qualified names instead of
       simple hostnames. You may want  to  use	the  strip-domain
       feature	-s  of	this  server. You can tell the syslogd to
       strip off several domains other than the one the server is
       located in and only log simple hostnames.

       Using  the  -l option there's also a possibility to define
       single hosts as local machines. This, too, results in log
       ging only their simple hostnames and not the fqdns.

       The UDP socket used to forward messages to remote hosts or
       to receive messages from them is only opened  when  it  is
       needed.	 In  releases prior to 1.3-23 it was opened every
       time but not opened  for	 reading  or  forwarding  respec
       tively.


OUTPUT TO NAMED PIPES (FIFOs)
       This  version of syslogd has support for logging output to
       named pipes (fifos).  A fifo or named pipe can be used  as
       a destination for log messages by prepending a pipy symbol
       (``|'') to the name of the file. This is handy for  debug
       ging.  Note  that the fifo must be created with the mkfifo
       command before syslogd is started.

	      The following configuration file routes debug  mes
	      sages from the kernel to a fifo:

		   # Sample configuration to route kernel debugging
		   # messages ONLY to /usr/adm/debug which is a
		   # named pipe.
		   kern.=debug		    |/usr/adm/debug

INSTALLATION CONCERNS
       There   is   probably  one  important  consideration  when
       installing this version of syslogd.  This version of  sys
       logd  is dependent on proper formatting of messages by the
       syslog function.	 The functioning of the	 syslog	 function
       in the shared libraries changed somewhere in the region of
       libc.so.4.[2-4].n.  The specific change was to null-termi
       nate  the  message  before transmitting it to the /dev/log
       socket.	Proper functioning of this version of syslogd  is
       dependent on null-termination of the message.

       This  problem will typically manifest itself if old stati
       cally linked binaries are being used on the system.  Bina
       ries  using old versions of the syslog function will cause
       empty lines to be logged followed by the message with  the
       first  character	 in the message removed.  Relinking these
       binaries to newer versions of the  shared  libraries  will
       correct this problem.

       Both  the  syslogd(8)  and  the klogd(8) can either be run
       from init(8) or started as part of the rc.*  sequence.  If
       it  is started from init the option -n must be set, other
       wise you'll get tons of syslog daemons  started.	 This  is
       because init(8) depends on the process ID.


SECURITY THREATS
       There  is  the potential for the syslogd daemon to be used
       as a conduit for a denial of service attack.  Thanks go to
       John  Morrison  (jmorriso@rflab.ee.ubc.ca) for alerting me
       to this potential.  A rogue program(mer) could very easily
       flood the syslogd daemon with syslog messages resulting in
       the log files consuming all the	remaining  space  on  the
       filesystem.  Activating logging over the inet domain sock
       ets will of course expose a system  to  risks  outside  of
       programs or individuals on the local machine.

       There are a number of methods of protecting a machine:

       1.     Implement	 kernel	 firewalling to limit which hosts
	      or networks have access to the 514/UDP socket.

       2.     Logging can be directed to an isolated or	 non-root
	      filesystem  which,  if  filled, will not impair the
	      machine.

       3.     The ext2 filesystem can be used which can	 be  con
	      figured to limit a certain percentage of a filesys
	      tem to usage by root only.   NOTE	 that  this  will
	      require  syslogd	to  be run as a non-root process.
	      ALSO NOTE that this will prevent	usage  of  remote
	      logging since syslogd will be unable to bind to the
	      514/UDP socket.

       4.     Disabling inet domain sockets will  limit	 risk  to
	      the local machine.

       5.     Use  step	 4 and if the problem persists and is not
	      secondary to a rogue program/daemon get  a  3.5  ft
	      (approx.	1 meter) length of sucker rod* and have a
	      chat with the user in question.

	      Sucker rod def. -- 3/4, 7/8 or 1in. hardened  steel
	      rod, male threaded on each end.  Primary use in the
	      oil industry in  Western	North  Dakota  and  other
	      locations	 to pump 'suck' oil from oil wells.  Sec
	      ondary uses are for the construction of cattle feed
	      lots  and	 for dealing with the occasional recalci
	      trant or belligerent individual.


DEBUGGING
       When debugging is turned on using -d option  then  syslogd
       will  be	 very  verbose by writing much of what it does on
       stdout. Whenever the configuration file is reread and  re-
       parsed you'll see a tabular, corresponding to the internal
       data structure. This tabular consists of four fields:

       number This field contains a  serial  number  starting  by
	      zero.  This  number  represents the position in the
	      internal data structure (i.e. the	 array).  If  one
	      number  is left out then there might be an error in
	      the corresponding line in /etc/syslog.conf.

       pattern
	      This field is tricky and	represents  the	 internal
	      structure exactly. Every column stands for a facil
	      ity (refer to syslog(3)).	 As you	 can  see,  there
	      are still some facilities left free for former use,
	      only the left most are used. Every field in a  col
	      umn represents the priorities (refer to syslog(3)).

       action This field describes  the	 particular  action  that
	      takes  place  whenever  a	 message is received that
	      matches the pattern. Refer  to  the  syslog.conf(5)
	      manpage for all possible actions.

       arguments
	      This   field  shows  additional  arguments  to  the
	      actions in the last field. For file-logging this is
	      the filename for the logfile; for user-logging this
	      is a list of users; for remote logging this is  the
	      hostname of the machine to log to; for console-log
	      ging this is the used console; for tty-logging this
	      is  the specified tty; wall has no additional argu
	      ments.

SYSKLOGD(8)	   Linux System Administration	      SYSKLOGD(8)


FILES
       /etc/syslog.conf
	      Configuration file for syslogd.  See syslog.conf(5)
	      for exact information.
       /dev/log
	      The  Unix	 domain socket to from where local syslog
	      messages are read.
       /var/run/syslogd.pid
	      The file containing the process id of syslogd.

BUGS
       If an error occurs in one line the whole rule is	 ignored.

       Syslogd	doesn't change the filemode of opened logfiles at
       any stage of process. If a file is  created  it	is  world
       readable. If you want to avoid this, you have to create it
       and change permissions on your own.  This could be done in
       combination  with  rotating  logfiles using the savelog(8)
       program that is shipped in  the	smail  3.x  distribution.
       Remember	 that it might be a security hole if everybody is
       able to read auth.* messages as these might contain  pass
       words.
