NAME
       syslog.conf - syslogd(8) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The  syslog.conf	 file  is the main configuration file for
       the syslogd(8) which logs system messages on *nix systems.
       This  file  specifies  rules for logging. For special fea
       tures see the sysklogd(8) manpage.

       Every rule consists of two fields, a selector field and an
       action  field.  These  two  fields are separated by one or
       more spaces or tabs. The selector field specifies  a  pat
       tern  of facilities and priorities belonging to the speci
       fied action.

       Lines starting with a hash mark (``#'')	and  empty  lines
       are ignored.

       This  release of syslogd is able to understand an extended
       syntax.	One rule can be divided into several lines if the
       leading line is terminated with an backslash (``\'').


SELECTORS
       The  selector  field itself again consists of two parts, a
       facility and a priority, separated by  a	 period	 (``.'').
       Both  parts are case insensitive and can also be specified
       as decimal numbers, but	don't  do  that,  you  have  been
       warned.	Both  facilities  and priorities are described in
       syslog(3).  The names mentioned below  correspond  to  the
       similar LOG_-values in /usr/include/syslog.h.

       The facility is one of the following keywords: auth, auth
       priv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, mark, news,	 security
       (same  as  auth),  syslog,  user,  uucp and local0 through
       local7.	The keyword security should not be  used  anymore
       and mark is only for internal use and therefore should not
       be used in applications. Anyway, you may want  to  specify
       and  redirect  these messages here. The facility specifies
       the subsystem that produced the	message,  i.e.	all  mail
       programs log with the mail facility (LOG_MAIL) if they log
       using syslog.

       The priority is one of the following keywords, in  ascend
       ing  order:  debug,  info,  notice, warning, warn (same as
       warning), err, error (same as err),  crit,  alert,  emerg,
       panic (same as emerg).  The keywords error, warn and panic
       are deprecated and should not be used anymore. The  prior_
       ity defines the severity of the message

       The  behavior of the original BSD syslogd is that all mes
       sages of the specified  priority	 and  higher  are  logged
       according to the given action. This syslogd(8) behaves the
       same, but has some extensions.



Version 1.3		  1 January 1998			1





SYSLOG.CONF(5)	   Linux System Administration	   SYSLOG.CONF(5)


       In addition to the above mentioned  names  the  syslogd(8)
       understands  the following extensions: An asterisk (``*'')
       stands for all facilities or all priorities, depending  on
       where it is used (before or after the period). The keyword
       none stands for no priority of the given facility.

       You can specify multiple facilities with the same priority
       pattern in one statement using the comma (``,'') operator.
       You may specify as much facilities as you want.	 Remember
       that  only  the	facility  part	from  such a statement is
       taken, a priority part would be skipped.

       Multiple selectors may be specified for	a  single  action
       using the semicolon (``;'') separator.  Remember that each
       selector in the selector field is capable to overwrite the
       preceding  ones.	 Using this behavior you can exclude some
       priorities from the pattern.

       This syslogd(8) has a syntax extension to the original BSD
       source,	that makes its use more intuitively. You may pre
       cede every priority with an equation sign (``='') to spec
       ify  only  this	single priority and not any of the above.
       You may also (both is valid,  too)  precede  the	 priority
       with an exclamation mark (``!'') to ignore all that prior
       ities, either exact this one or this and any higher prior
       ity.  If you use both extensions than the exclamation mark
       must occur before the equation sign,  just  use	it  intu
       itively.


ACTIONS
       The  action  field  of  a rule describes the abstract term
       ``logfile''. A ``logfile'' need not to  be  a  real  file,
       btw. The syslogd(8) provides the following actions.


   Regular File
       Typically  messages are logged to real files. The file has
       to be specified with full pathname, beginning with a slash
       ``/''.

       You  may	 prefix	 each  entry with the minus ``-'' sign to
       omit syncing the file after every logging. Note	that  you
       might  lose information if the system crashes right behind
       a write attempt. Nevertheless this  might  give	you  back
       some  performance, especially if you run programs that use
       logging in a very verbose manner.


   Named Pipes
       This version of syslogd(8) has support for logging  output
       to  named  pipes (fifos). A fifo or named pipe can be used
       as a destination for log messages  by  prepending  a  pipe
       symbol  (``|'') to the name of the file. This is handy for



Version 1.3		  1 January 1998			2





SYSLOG.CONF(5)	   Linux System Administration	   SYSLOG.CONF(5)


       debugging. Note that the fifo must  be  created	with  the
       mkfifo(1) command  before syslogd(8) is started.


   Terminal and Console
       If  the	file you specified is a tty, special tty-handling
       is done, same with /dev/console.


   Remote Machine
       This syslogd(8) provides full remote logging, i.e. is able
       to  send	 messages to a remote host running syslogd(8) and
       to receive messages from remote	hosts.	The  remote  host
       won't  forward  the  message  again, it will just log them
       locally. To forward messages to another host, prepend  the
       hostname with the at sign (``@'').

       Using  this feature you're able to control all syslog mes
       sages on one host, if all other machines will log remotely
       to that. This tears down administration needs.


   List of Users
       Usually critical messages are also directed to ``root'' on
       that machine. You can specify a list of users  that  shall
       get the message by simply writing the login. You may spec
       ify more than one user  by  separating  them  with  commas
       (``,'').	 If they're logged in they get the message. Don't
       think a mail would be sent, that might be too late.


   Everyone logged on
       Emergency messages often go to all users currently  online
       to  notify  them	 that something strange is happening with
       the system. To specify this wall(1)-feature use an  aster
       isk (``*'').


EXAMPLES
       Here  are some example, partially taken from a real exist
       ing site and configuration. Hopefully  they  rub	 out  all
       questions  to  the configuration, if not, drop me (Joey) a
       line.

	      # Store critical stuff in critical
	      #
	      *.=crit;kern.none		   /var/adm/critical

       This will store all messages with the priority crit in the
       file /var/adm/critical, except for any kernel message.


	      # Kernel messages are first, stored in the kernel
	      # file, critical messages and higher ones also go



Version 1.3		  1 January 1998			3





SYSLOG.CONF(5)	   Linux System Administration	   SYSLOG.CONF(5)


	      # to another host and to the console
	      #
	      kern.*			   /var/adm/kernel
	      kern.crit			   @finlandia
	      kern.crit			   /dev/console
	      kern.info;kern.!err	   /var/adm/kernel-info

       The  first  rule	 direct	 any  message that has the kernel
       facility to the file /var/adm/kernel.

       The second statement directs all kernel	messages  of  the
       priority	 crit  and  higher  to the remote host finlandia.
       This is useful, because if the host crashes and the  disks
       get  irreparable	 errors you might not be able to read the
       stored messages. If they're on a	 remote	 host,	too,  you
       still can try to find out the reason for the crash.

       The  third  rule directs these messages to the actual con
       sole, so the person who works  on  the  machine	will  get
       them, too.

       The  fourth line tells the syslogd to save all kernel mes
       sages that come with priorities from info up to warning in
       the  file  /var/adm/kernel-info.	  Everything from err and
       higher is excluded.


	      # The tcp wrapper loggs with mail.info, we display
	      # all the connections on tty12
	      #
	      mail.=info		   /dev/tty12

       This directs all messages that uses mail.info  (in  source
       LOG_MAIL	 | LOG_INFO) to /dev/tty12, the 12th console. For
       example the tcpwrapper tcpd(8) uses this as it's	 default.


	      # Store all mail concerning stuff in a file
	      #
	      mail.*;mail.!=info	   /var/adm/mail

       This  pattern matches all messages that come with the mail
       facility, except for the	 info  priority.  These	 will  be
       stored in the file /var/adm/mail.


	      # Log all mail.info and news.info messages to info
	      #
	      mail,news.=info		   /var/adm/info

       This  will  extract  all	 messages  that	 come either with
       mail.info or with news.info and store  them  in	the  file
       /var/adm/info.




Version 1.3		  1 January 1998			4





SYSLOG.CONF(5)	   Linux System Administration	   SYSLOG.CONF(5)


	      # Log info and notice messages to messages file
	      #
	      *.=info;*.=notice;\
		   mail.none  /var/log/messages

       This  lets  the	syslogd	 log  all messages that come with
       either the info or  the	notice	facility  into	the  file
       /var/log/messages,  except  for	all messages that use the
       mail facility.


	      # Log info messages to messages file
	      #
	      *.=info;\
		   mail,news.none	/var/log/messages

       This statement causes the syslogd to log all messages that
       come with the info priority to the file /var/log/messages.
       But any message coming either with the mail  or	the  news
       facility will not be stored.


	      # Emergency messages will be displayed using wall
	      #
	      *.=emerg			   *

       This  rule  tells  the syslogd to write all emergency mes
       sages to all currently logged in users. This is	the  wall
       action.


	      # Messages of the priority alert will be directed
	      # to the operator
	      #
	      *.alert			   root,joey

       This rule directs all messages with a priority of alert or
       higher to the terminals of the operator, i.e. of the users
       ``root'' and ``joey'' if they're logged in.


	      *.*			   @finlandia

       This  rule  would  redirect  all messages to a remote host
       called finlandia. This is useful especially in  a  cluster
       of  machines  where  all syslog messages will be stored on
       only one machine.


CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES
       Syslogd uses a slightly different syntax for its	 configu
       ration  file than the original BSD sources. Originally all
       messages of a specific priority and above  were	forwarded
       to  the	log  file.  The modifiers ``='', ``!''	and ``-''

       were added to make the syslogd more flexible and to use it
       in a more intuitive manner.

       The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as sep
       arators between the selector and the action field.

FILES

BUGS
       The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not  intu
       itive.	For   example	``mail.crit,*.err''  will  select
       ``mail'' facility messages at  the  level  of  ``err''  or
       higher, not at the level of ``crit'' or higher.
